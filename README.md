# ISD-05-Customer-Support-Chatbot-with-ML

Here's how it works:

Users enter a pincode, and the platform lists all hospitals in that area. Once a hospital is selected, you can initiate a chat with them.

The chat is initially held by AI. If the AI can't answer your question, it connects you to a human support representative.

This is aimed for real-time questions like

- Which doctor is in the OPD today?
- Are beds or specific medicines available?

All conversations are stored in a vector database for future responses.

For static details like hospital timings, cost of treatment, or general medicine information, platforms like Google are better suited.
